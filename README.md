# Machine Learning Assignment 

## Instructions
Please download the IRIS data set introduced in the course, conduct training and testing with the traditional machine learning algorithm introduced in the course, and write a test report to upload.

A total of 5 algorithms are included, and each test report contains:

1. Experimental settings and results: Each algorithm selects two parameters, changes their set values, conducts experiments, and records and compares the experimental results. For example, the penalty and solver of Logistic Regression

2. Conclusion: Based on the above experimental results, write observation conclusions
